# Team Waypoints Reminder
Creates a chat message reminder to set Team Waypoints (Buddy Points) after a match starts in tournament mode.

### Summary
The purpose of this script is to create a automatic chat message reminder to set team waypoints (Buddy Points) at the start of a tournament match. Explicitly, this script will *only* create message when the server is in tournament mode. It is assumed that if the tournament is in any other mode, then the match is serious enough for a reminder.

The primary reason for creating this script is that setting Buddy Points must be a manual action. As of writing this, others have attempted to create an automatic Buddy Points script, but some servers blocked the action (considering it a cheat?). As a result, the best second option is to simply remind the player to set waypoints manually before the match starts.

The script will fire after *mission start*, not map start. Mission Start is the 30 second countdown before the match begins. This should give a player plenty of time to set waypoints as needed.

*Final Note:* The functionality in this script is automatically included in the Team Waypoints Manager script. If you are using that script, then you do not need to use this script. However, there is no conflict in using both at the same time.
